# Heart Attack Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a heart attack for individuals based on various health-related features. The dataset used for training and testing the model is [provide_dataset_name]. The objective is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the probability of a person experiencing a heart attack.

## Dataset

- The dataset used for this project can be found at [provide_dataset_link].
- Explain the features present in the dataset, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
- Provide information on the target variable, which indicates whether a person had a heart attack or not.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python [version]
- Jupyter Notebook [if applicable]
- Required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)
